# Project 5: Diffusion equation
In this folder there are 2 subfolders [code](https://github.com/SigurdSundberg/FYS3150/tree/master/project5/code), [report](https://github.com/SigurdSundberg/FYS3150/tree/master/project5/report).
Which contains what is self explanatory.
## Code
All the code was run on the following specs:

Computer  : Lenovo IdeaPad Flexx 5 14IIL05<br />
Version   : Ubuntu 20.04 1 LTS <br />
Processor : Intel Core i5-1035G1 Processor 6MB @ 1.00GHz x8 <br />
Memory    : 8.0GB DDR4-3200 DDR4 Soldered 3200MHz <br />
Graphics  : Mesa IntelÂ® UHD Graphics (ICL GT1) <br />

Subfolder `cpp` includes a makefile for compiling the programs, in addition to the C++ code used for the calculations. The folder `scripts` includes the python scripts used to create the plots. 

No appropriate test where written as testing numerical methods directly can be trouble some, the comparison to the analytical solutions functions as the tests.

## Report
In here the Latex file and the pdf for the report are included, in addition to the figures used.
