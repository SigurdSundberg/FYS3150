# Code folder 

Here all programs are ran from ```main.py´´´, no input arguments needed. 
```cpp_codes´´´ contains all the C++ used for the problem solving. 
This folder also contains a folder called ```class´´´, this is to be disregarded, since it is a botched attempt at turning the functional based program, into an object oriented one.
