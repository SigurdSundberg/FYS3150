# Project 2: Eigenvalue problems
In this folder there are 2 subfolders [code](https://github.com/SigurdSundberg/FYS3150/tree/master/project2/code) and [report](https://github.com/SigurdSundberg/FYS3150/tree/master/project2/report) which contains what is self explanatory.
## Code
All the code was run on the following specs:

Computer  : Lenovo IdeaPad Flexx 5 14IIL05<br />
Version   : Ubuntu 20.04 1 LTS <br />
Processor : Intel Core i5-1035G1 Processor 6MB @ 1.00GHz x8 <br />
Memory    : 8.0GB DDR4-3200 DDR4 Soldered 3200MHz <br />
Graphics  : Mesa Intel® UHD Graphics (ICL GT1) <br />

The main programs are in the files ```main.cpp``` and are ran through the use of the program ```main.py``` which automates the compiling, running and all other parts of the process.

In the folder ```code```  there are subfolders for the different ```problemtype_data´´´ are benchmark samples for the tests ran and other output files. 
```problemtype_plots``` contain the plots included in the report. 
All other python files found in ```scipts´´´, are just files called by ```main.py```. 

## Report
Here you will find the report. Bibtex was used for the bibliography.
