# Code folder structure 

In here you will find the following folders
> Classes <br />
> scripts <br />

```main.py``` has no function implementation. This is as of this commit a dead file.

### cpp
This folder containts all the c++ code, in addition to the ```data``` folder containing selected runs. The runs are for the 2x2 lattice and for the study of the phase transition. 

The code should have been written as functions in a header file or class base, this was not done however. It can be done easily, but starting to tackle possible bugs when transitioning to a class based program late in the working cycle, is not favourable. 

### scripts 
Containts python scripts to create the plots seen in the report. They are all designed to have the filename within edited for files on a certain format.
