# Code folder structure 

In here you will find the following folders
> Classes <br />
> functional_implementation <br />
> scripts <br />

### Classes
This folder contains the implemented classes used by ```main.cpp``` to simluate the solar system using OO. 

### functional_implementation
This folder contains the functional implementation of the Euler and velocity verler method as a check on wether the programs where implemented correctly. This folder contains its own main function and is not related to the rest of the project other than a baseline test of implementation. This is not finished code due to time restraints and problems with getting a clear structure in the program using functions. A lot of the code ended up rather being bloated and hard to read and trouble shoot. 

### scripts 
This folder contains python scripts used by ```main.py```. Some functions can also by found in the top folder ```python_scripts```
