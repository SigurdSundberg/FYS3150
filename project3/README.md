# Project 3: Building a model for the solar system using ODEs.
In this folder there are 3 subfolders [code](https://github.com/SigurdSundberg/FYS3150/tree/master/project3/code), [report](https://github.com/SigurdSundberg/FYS3150/tree/master/project3/report) and [sample data](https://github.com/SigurdSundberg/FYS3150/tree/master/project3/sample_data).
Which contains what is self explanatory.
## Code
All the code was run on the following specs:

Computer  : Lenovo IdeaPad Flexx 5 14IIL05<br />
Version   : Ubuntu 20.04 1 LTS <br />
Processor : Intel Core i5-1035G1 Processor 6MB @ 1.00GHz x8 <br />
Memory    : 8.0GB DDR4-3200 DDR4 Soldered 3200MHz <br />
Graphics  : Mesa IntelÂ® UHD Graphics (ICL GT1) <br />

To create the files to run, one can simply type ```make``` in the ``classes`` directory. main takes one input argutment, 2, 3 or 10, depending on what system is desired. This does not recreate the data plots, as this functionality is not implemented. Neither does the ```main.py``` file do anything, this has also not been implemented due to time constraints.
