# FYS3150
Course folder for projects in FYS3150 at UiO

### Projects 
All the projects will be in their respective folders. All which will have the two main subfolders, code and report referenceing the code base and the report itself. 

### Project 1
This project is on numerical precision and runtime. Used as a base to measure this was the one dimensional Poisson equation. 

### Project 2
This project is on numerical methods for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The methods implemented here are Bisection method and the Jacobi method. We compare run times and looking at number of iterations between the methods. And applying the methods to a classical mechanics problem and quantum mechanics problem.
